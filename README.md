This repository contains five scripts that -- taken step by step -- build up to a program that retrieves data from the Primo API and parses it into CSV format.

The steps are:

0.  Let's just see how JSON works
1.  Make a GET request and print the results
2.  Now save the results
3.  Now parse the results to extract something interesting
4.  Finally, turn the extracted data into CSV format


The API calls will only work from authorized IPs.
