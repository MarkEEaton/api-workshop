This repository contains four scripts that -- taken step by step -- build up to a script that retrieves API data and parses it into CSV format.

The steps are:
1. Make a GET request and print the results
2. Now save the results
3. Now parse the results to extract something interesting
4. Finally, turn the extracted data into CSV format
